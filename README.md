## 🧭 About the Club
The St. Clair Robotics Club is a student-led organization focused on **hands-on robotics projects**, creative problem-solving, and collaborative learning.  

We design and build robots that explore areas such as mobility, automation, sensing, and control.  
Through these projects, members gain practical experience in:

- Microcontrollers (Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino, ESP32, etc.)  
- CAD design and 3D printing  
- Electronics, sensors, and PCB design  
- Programming (Python, C/C++, ROS)  
- Mechanical design and system integration  

Whether you're new to robotics or an experienced builder, there’s a place for you here!
