🧠 Replit Prompt — “Humanize and Polish the St. Clair Robotics Club Website”

Repository: /docs (live GitHub Pages source)
Objective:
Audit and upgrade every aspect of the St. Clair Robotics Club website that makes it look AI-generated, low-effort, or template-based. Identify design, structure, and content flaws that reduce credibility or viewer engagement. Then, refactor the site to feel human, student-driven, and technically competent — like a real robotics team built it.

🔍 Step 1 – Audit for “AI-Generated” Artifacts

Evaluate the following categories in /docs and all subpages (index.html, about.html, etc.).
List any issues that make the site look auto-generated or impersonal, and immediately suggest humanized fixes.

1. Visual Design & Layout

Low-effort signs:

Default section templates (e.g. “About Us” blocks with lorem ipsum or vague text).

Generic gradients or random neon accents that don’t match the St. Clair College brand.

Inconsistent margins, uneven padding, or boxy layout rhythm.

No cohesive grid or visual hierarchy.

Unbalanced spacing on hero and footer.

Fixes:

Redesign the hero with one clear photo/video background, real club imagery, and a primary CTA (“Join the Robotics Club”).

Apply a consistent 8 px spacing grid and even section padding.

Use a high-contrast palette tied to St. Clair green (#78be20) and neutral tech grays.

Create a sticky, semi-transparent nav bar with backdrop-filter for clarity while scrolling.

2. Typography & Readability

Low-effort signs:

Generic fonts (Arial/Roboto default combo).

Center-aligned body text everywhere.

Random heading sizes and inconsistent capitalization.

Long text blocks with poor scanning flow.

Fixes:

Use Inter for body and Poppins / Orbitron for headings (for a robotics-tech feel).

Keep line-length ~70 chars; left-align paragraphs.

Establish consistent heading scale: h1 2.5rem, h2 1.75rem, h3 1.25rem.

Use real project names (e.g. “Iris Autonomous Platform”) instead of placeholders.

3. Content & Copywriting

Low-effort signs:

AI-style vague phrasing: “We are passionate about innovation and technology.”

No clear sense of who the club is or what they actually do.

Missing context (e.g., no mention of St. Clair College, Windsor, Optimotive, or real members).

Fixes:

Rewrite all blurbs in an authentic student tone:
“We’re the St. Clair College Robotics Club — a team of students building autonomous robots and competing across Ontario.”

Add project blurbs with names, goals, and photos.

Include a short “About Us” timeline or member highlights.

Replace filler with real callouts (e.g., “Meet Iris — our autonomous research robot”).

4. Imagery & Media

Low-effort signs:

Generic stock robotics images or AI renders.

Repeated placeholders like “team photo.jpg”.

Missing or distorted aspect ratios.

Fixes:

Use authentic photos from lab, competitions, or workshops.

Add alt text with descriptive context (“Members calibrating an ABB robot arm in the St. Clair lab”).

Use .webp or compressed .jpg with loading="lazy".

Keep consistent color grading and framing for all images.

5. Structure & Navigation

Low-effort signs:

Repetitive nav items (“Home”, “Main”, “Start Here”).

Links that scroll nowhere or dead “Learn More” buttons.

No sticky behavior or orientation cues.

Fixes:

Streamline nav: About, Projects, Join, Contact.

Anchor internal links (#about, #projects, etc.) with smooth scroll.

Add “Back to Top” button after 600 px scroll.

Highlight current section in nav (active state).

6. Interactivity & Engagement

Low-effort signs:

Static, brochure-like feel.

Over-the-top template animations.

No meaningful ways to interact.

Fixes:

Add hover states and subtle motion (fade, slide-in) respecting prefers-reduced-motion.

Create one interactive element — e.g., project gallery filter, mini controller simulator, or signup form.

Integrate simple Discord join or email subscribe CTA near the bottom.

7. SEO / Metadata / Accessibility

Low-effort signs:

Missing or default <title> (“My Site”).

No OpenGraph previews or meta descriptions.

Low-contrast color text on dark backgrounds.

Improper heading order (h1 → h4 → h2).

Fixes:

Add <title>St. Clair Robotics Club | Windsor, Ontario</title>

<meta name="description" content="Student-run robotics team at St. Clair College designing autonomous robots and AI projects.">

Add OG/Twitter tags for better sharing previews.

Audit with Lighthouse Accessibility — target 95+.

Ensure all images have alt text and all links use descriptive labels.

8. Performance & Code Quality

Low-effort signs:

Unused template JS/CSS bloating load times.

Inline styles and duplicated scripts.

No image optimization or caching.

Fixes:

Remove unused frameworks or libraries (Bootstrap 5 only if used consistently).

Minify and defer JS, compress CSS.

Use image compression and lazy loading.

Target Lighthouse Performance 90+.

9. Authenticity & Branding

Low-effort signs:

No consistent color, tone, or logo use.

Feels like a generic tech startup, not a college club.

Fixes:

Use St. Clair College color palette (green, black, gray, white).

Include official logo and consistent wordmark spacing.

Show real member faces with consent.

Add short mission statement and tagline:
“Building the future of robotics, one servo at a time.”

🧩 Step 2 – Generate a Structured Report

Output a Markdown file summarizing:

Each issue detected.

Direct references to HTML sections or CSS files (/docs/index.html, /docs/style.css, etc.).

Specific, actionable fixes (with CSS/HTML snippets where relevant).

Priority levels: Quick Fix → High-Impact → Long-Term.

Example:

### Hero Section
❌ Generic gradient background with placeholder text.
✅ Replace with club event photo background + CTA button “Join the Club”.
---

### About Section
❌ AI-generated paragraph full of buzzwords.
✅ Replace with real description of the Robotics Club, projects, and members.

🧠 Step 3 – Humanization Pass

Once all technical issues are noted, perform a “Humanization Pass”:

Rewrite robotic copy into authentic student-driven voice.

Introduce personal context: who the members are, where they work (labs, Optimotive, competitions).

Add emotion, humor, and curiosity without sacrificing professionalism.

Ensure tone matches an intelligent but welcoming college club.
