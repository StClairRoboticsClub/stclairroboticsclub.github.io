🧠 Replit Prompt: “St. Clair Robotics Club Website Enhancement”

Objective:
Improve viewer retention, engagement, and shareability of the St. Clair Robotics Club website.
Work only within the /docs folder (and its subfolders). Do not modify or create files outside /docs.

🎯 Key Outcomes

Instant engagement: Clear, high-contrast hero with visible CTA above the fold.

Smooth orientation: Sticky navigation bar, anchor links for scrolling, and a “Back to top” button.

Lead capture: Working form (Name, Email, Interests) on join.html with validation and fallback.

Social share & identity: Complete OpenGraph/Twitter metadata, canonical URLs, favicon, and sharp logo rendering.

Performance: Lazy-loading, intrinsic image sizing, async decoding, compressed assets.

Accessibility: Fully navigable with keyboard, reduced-motion compliant, correct focus states.

Analytics ready: Hero CTA and outbound link click tracking hooks.

Compelling content: “Why Join” and “Recent Highlights” sections on the homepage.

🧩 Tasks & Implementation Requirements
A. Navigation & Scrolling

Make the top nav sticky with position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 1000;.

Add a semi-transparent backdrop (rgba() + backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) with a solid fallback.

Add anchor links to sections (#about, #projects, #join).

Implement a small “Back to top” button that appears after 600px scroll; must be keyboard-focusable and have an aria-label.

Add a minimal scroll progress bar (2–3 px tall) at the top of the viewport.

B. Hero & CTA

Ensure the primary CTA (Join/Discord) is visible without scrolling on laptop/mobile (use min-height: clamp(70vh, 85vh, 100vh)).

Strengthen CTA contrast and create an obvious :focus-visible style.

Maintain existing dark theme and fonts.

C. Lead Capture (Join Form)

Add a form on join.html with Name, Email, and Interests (optional).

Provide inline validation and success message.

Use Formspree or Netlify Forms for submission; if backend unavailable, use mailto: fallback and note it in UI.

Keep Discord/Instagram buttons but place form first visually.

D. Images & Performance

Add loading="lazy" to all non-hero images.

Add decoding="async" and explicit width/height attributes.

Compress large images (≤1200 px wide, 75–80 % quality).

Keep hero and logo images non-lazy.

Comment in HTML where image compression is recommended.

E. Accessibility & Motion

Wrap all animations/transitions in:

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) { /* animations */ }


Add clear :focus-visible styles with ≥3:1 contrast ratio.

Verify all images have appropriate alt text (use empty alt="" for decorative).

F. Social Sharing & Branding

In every page <head> (especially index.html):

<meta property="og:title" content="St. Clair Robotics Club">
<meta property="og:description" content="Build. Code. Create. Join the student-led robotics club at St. Clair College.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://stclairroboticsclub.ca/images/og-cover.jpg">
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://stclairroboticsclub.ca/">
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<link rel="canonical" href="https://stclairroboticsclub.ca/">
<link rel="icon" href="images/favicon.ico" sizes="16x16 32x32" type="image/x-icon">
<link rel="manifest" href="site.webmanifest">


Export or create /docs/images/og-cover.jpg (1200×630).

Ensure logo looks crisp on dark backgrounds.

G. Content Structure & Social Proof

Add a “Why Join” section (3–5 bullet benefits: hands-on builds, resume value, competitions, networking, creativity).

Add a “Recent Highlights” or “Milestones” strip (3–4 short items with dates).

Optionally, add a “Partners/Sponsors” row with placeholder logos.

H. Analytics & Measurement

In /docs/script.js, add lightweight analytics hooks that log or call console.log() for:

Hero CTA click

Outbound Discord/Instagram clicks

Include a commented placeholder for GA4 or other analytics script (disabled by default).

I. Housekeeping

Confirm exactly one <h1> per page.

All headings nested logically (h2 > h3 etc.).

Verify color contrast on all text and buttons.

Remove redundant duplicate links within same viewport.

Keep spacing generous, consistent rounded buttons, and bold hover glows.

📁 Files to Update in /docs

index.html

join.html

about.html

team.html

style.css

script.js (create or modify as needed)

New assets:

/docs/images/og-cover.jpg (1200×630 px)

/docs/images/favicon.ico or .png

Optional: /docs/site.webmanifest

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Sticky nav & progress line function correctly.

“Back to top” button visible after scrolling.

Lead form exists and validates correctly (with fallback).

OG/Twitter/meta/favicon load properly.

Non-hero images lazy-loaded, sized, and async decoded.

Reduced-motion preference respected.

“Why Join” + “Highlights” appear on homepage.

Analytics hooks log CTA and outbound clicks.

Lighthouse shows no major accessibility, SEO, or meta errors.

⚠️ Critical Quality Notes

Use absolute URLs for OG images in production.

Never lazy-load logo or first-fold hero.

All new buttons must be keyboard accessible.

Ensure scroll/animation effects are disabled if prefers-reduced-motion.

Comment any external dependencies (Formspree, GA, etc.) clearly.

💡 Style Guidance

Preserve the current dark aesthetic, font choices, and voice.

Keep call-to-action copy strong and concise (“Build. Code. Create.”).

Maintain consistent rounded-corner button styling and subtle hover glow.

Avoid corporate tone — stay authentic, collegiate, and energetic.
